Final Project Introduction from Udacity:

This particular dataset is taken from Udacity forums the first months after launch. 

Udacity forums are run on free, opensource software called OSQA, which was designed to be similar to the popular StackOverflow forums.
The basic structure is - the forum has nodes. All nodes have a body and author_id. 

Top level nodes are called questions, and will also have a title and tags. 
Questions can have answers. Both questions and answers can have comments. 
If you are not sure how that all looks, please go to the class discussion forum and look around.
